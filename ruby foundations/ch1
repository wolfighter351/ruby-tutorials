# 1.1
# Examples
# Ruby supports basic math operations for numbers +,-,*,/
# You can mix floats and integers and will default the result to a float
# when using a float that begins with zero it must be included
# ex. 1 / 0.25 (okay), 1 / .25 (not okay)

You can print something to the screen using the commands print, puts or p
print does not include a newline character by default, so print 'hello' followed by
print 'moto' would display 'hellomoto' on same line (notice there is no added space either).
Also notice that the above words are surrounded by quotes or double quotes in ruby (almost all programming languages, actually)
these are called strings. Puts command (actually lowercase puts when used in ruby) does the same thing as print but adds a newline
at the end of a string if it is not already there.

print 'hello'
print 'moto'
puts 'hello'
puts 'goodbye'
